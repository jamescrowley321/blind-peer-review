# Security Policy

Blind Peer Review is a GitHub Action that runs AI review agents on pull requests
with access to a repository's diff and a provider API key. A vulnerability here
could leak that key, post forged reviews, or let malicious PR content subvert the
merge gate — so reports are taken seriously and triaged promptly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Report privately through GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/jamescrowley321/blind-peer-review/security/advisories/new)**
(repository **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**). This opens a private
advisory visible only to you and the maintainers, where a fix can be coordinated.

When you report, please include as much of the following as you can:

- The affected version / commit or tag (`v3`, a SHA, …).
- The security impact — e.g. provider-key exposure, a prompt-injection that
  defeats the untrusted-PR-content trust boundary, a way to make the merge gate
  pass with unresolved MUST FIX findings, or forged/spoofed lens reviews.
- A minimal reproduction — ideally a sample PR diff/description that demonstrates
  the problem.

## What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days.
- An initial assessment (severity, affected versions, likely fix) within 10
  business days.
- Coordinated disclosure: a fix is prepared privately, released, and only then is
  the advisory published — with credit to the reporter unless you prefer to
  remain anonymous.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are made against the latest release and the current moving major
tag (`v3`). Older major releases are not supported; fixes are not backported.

## Scope

In scope: `action.yml`, the lens personas and shared output contract in
`lenses/`, the merge-gate and provenance logic, the Claude Code plugin, local
adapters, vendoring and review dispatch scripts, and the shared findings contract.

Out of scope (report upstream): the [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) runtime and
[`shaftoe/pi-coding-agent-action`](https://github.com/shaftoe/pi-coding-agent-action),
and the model provider (e.g. OpenRouter) and the models themselves.

## Hardening: protecting your provider key

`mode: lens` spends your provider key (e.g. OpenRouter) on every reviewed PR, so
treat the key as the primary asset to protect. The action and the example caller
already close the main abuse paths; the rest is your repo/provider configuration:

- **Read-only agent.** The lens agent's tool allowlist (`loaded_tools`) is
  read-only by default — no shell, file-write, push, or PR-write tool — so a
  prompt-injected PR diff cannot exfiltrate the key or mutate the repo (OWASP
  LLM01). Don't broaden `loaded_tools` unless you accept that tradeoff.
- **Fork PRs get no key.** Secrets are withheld from fork pull requests by
  default, and the example caller also guards on `head.repo.fork == false`. Keep
  **Settings → Actions → Fork pull request workflows → Require approval for all
  outside collaborators** enabled so a fork PR can't even start a workflow without
  a maintainer's approval.
- **Budget-cap a dedicated key.** Use a distinct provider key per repo with a hard
  monthly spend cap, and — if the provider supports it — a model allowlist and a
  rate limit. This bounds the blast radius even if every other control fails.
  Rotate the key if it is ever exposed.
- **An approval environment won't close the collaborator path — so this repo
  doesn't use one.** A GitHub **Environment** with a **required reviewer** looks
  like it gates spend, but with `on: pull_request` (not `pull_request_target`) a
  same-repo PR runs the workflow *as edited by its own commits*: a collaborator
  can drop the gate's `needs:`/`environment:` wiring and add a key-exfil step in
  the same PR, and the gate — which lives in the file they control — is never
  reached. So it only ever gates **accidental spend** and **forks** (which already
  get no secret), at the cost of a manual approval on every run. Actually closing
  the collaborator path needs the key as an **environment-scoped secret**
  referenced by **every** key-using job (an approval per parallel wave) *plus*
  branch protection / CODEOWNERS on `.github/workflows/**`. This repo's self-review
  takes the simpler route: **no approval gate** — the **budget-capped key** above
  and **fork PRs getting no secret** are the spend controls, backed by the per-run
  caps below.
- **Bound per-run cost.** `diff_max_lines` / `diff_max_bytes` cap tokens per
  review, `diff_ignore_patterns` skips lockfiles and build output, and a
  `timeout-minutes` on the review job plus `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` cap
  runaway or superseded runs.
