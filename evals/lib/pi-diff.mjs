// A faithful port of the agent action's own diff truncation, so an eval can
// exercise the FETCH PATH rather than only the inline-diff path.
//
// Ported from shaftoe/pi-coding-agent-action, the engine action.yml pins:
//   packages/pi-orchestrator/src/pi/tools/get-pr-diff.ts
//   @ 1f0be2391705316c12e0f504eab2e39c74ec2da8  (v2.28.0 — the pinned SHA)
//
// Why a port and not a call: `get_pr_diff` only exists inside a live agent
// session with a GitHub provider attached. The harness has neither, so the only
// way to put a lens in front of a genuinely truncated diff is to reproduce what
// the tool would have handed it — byte-for-byte, markers included.
//
// A port can drift from upstream. Two things keep that honest: the pinned SHA
// above names exactly what this mirrors, and `contract.test.mjs` asserts the
// marker text and the bytes-before-lines precedence, so a silent divergence
// shows up as a failing test rather than as a fixture that stops meaning
// anything. Re-check this file whenever the pin in action.yml moves.

  // `undefined` regardless — the `?? 0` handles the documented return, it does
  // not paper over an out-of-bounds access.) Pinned by "the UTF-8 walk-back
  // never reads past the buffer" in contract.test.mjs.

  // UPSTREAM QUIRK, reproduced deliberately: when maxBytes is smaller than the
  // marker itself (< ~29), `budget` goes negative, `subarray(0, negative)`
  // takes its from-the-end meaning, and the result can exceed maxBytes. Caps
  // that small do not occur in production (the shipped default is 204800) and

/**
 * The tool RESULT text, as the agent receives it. The fence and the `PR #n
 * Diff:` header are part of what get_pr_diff returns, so a fetch-path fixture
 * that omits them is not reproducing the fetch path.
 *
 * REFUSES rather than escapes. Upstream interpolates the diff into this fence
 * without escaping it (docs/upstream-issues.md #3), so a diff containing a
 * fence closes the block early and everything after it reads as prose instead
 * of quoted tool output. Two ways to handle that, and only one of them is
 * honest here:
 *
 *   - Escaping it would make this function emit a payload the real tool never
 *     produces. Every fetch fixture would then measure something no lens
 *     receives, which is the one thing the fetch path exists to avoid.
 *   - Refusing keeps the contract "reproduce the tool result exactly, or do
 *     not run at all". A prompt with a broken fence is not a measurement of
 *     anything, so there is no case where emitting one is the right outcome.
 *
 * validate-fixtures.mjs catches this earlier and with a better message. This
 * check is here so the guarantee belongs to the function rather than to a
 * caller remembering to validate first — raised by Security Review on #40, and right:
 * a check that lives only in the validator is a check that a future caller
 * silently opts out of.
