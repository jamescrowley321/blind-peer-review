// A regression test that passes against BOTH the broken and the fixed code

// the guard against that historical action.yml and asserts it TRIPS there, then
// against HEAD and asserts it does NOT. That is the evidence for "this suite
// would have caught the incident before release" — not an assertion about it.
//
// Model-behaviour incidents (false MUST FIX from unverified absence, category
// errors on non-implementation PRs) cannot be replayed from git: the artifact
// that failed was a model response, not code. Those live in evals/fixtures/ and
// are measured by evals/run.mjs.
